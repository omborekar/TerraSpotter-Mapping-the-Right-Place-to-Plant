## About

TerraSpotter is a smart coordination platform designed to combat climate change by promoting afforestation. It bridges the gap between landowners and plantation groups (e.g., NGOs, schools, NSS units) by allowing users to register open land for tree planting. Using AI and Google Maps API, the platform estimates the number of trees suitable for a given area and recommends native species based on geolocation. A chatbot provides step-by-step guidance, while gamification and weekly image uploads ensure engagement and transparency.

The project aims to create a scalable, multilingual solution for sustainable tree planting, starting in Maharashtra with potential for global expansion.
